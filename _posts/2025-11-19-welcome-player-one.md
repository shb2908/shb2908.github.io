Welcome to my digital garden. As you read this text, notice the **XP Bar** at the top of the screen filling up?

That's right. This isn't just a blog; it's an RPG.

## How to Play

1. **Read Articles**: Scrolling down earns you XP.
2. **Level Up**: Reach 100 XP to hit Level 2.
3. **Find Secrets**: Hover over links to see their energy signature.
4. **Time Bonus**: Stay on pages to earn bonus XP over time.

## The Journey Begins

This blog is about scientific discovery, uncertainty, and the continuous quest for knowledge. Each post is a quest, and you're the player.

Stay tuned for more updates, and remember: **knowledge is the ultimate level-up**.
