# About Me

Hello, I am *Soham Bose*, an AI researcher and developer with a strong focus on natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision. I am driven by complex problem solving, enjoy deep exploration of large codebases, and actively engage with challenging engineering problems that require rigorous analytical thinking. Beyond this when I am not coding or brainsorming,I enjoy my time listening to music (huge fanatic of rock), and spend time playing the guitar. I also enjoy reading, and I am drawn to scific and thriller films and delve into complex narratives of it .

My current research agenda investigates how sensorimotor and multimodal training environments can provide richer supervisory signals and enable principled cross-modal reasoning, moving beyond architectures that treat secondary modalities as mere auxiliary inputs. I study representation learning and modality alignment with a focus on mechanistic interpretability, asking whether internal model activity reflects genuine abstract state variables and compositional structures or only surface-level statistical associations. Methodologically I combine controlled simulation platforms, causal and counterfactual interventions, and representational probes to isolate how models form and update latent state, encode relations, and generalize under distributional shifts. The work targets agent-centric benchmarks that permit systematic manipulation of sensory contingencies so that behavioral and circuit-level hypotheses can be tested reproducibly. Ultimately the goal is to develop models and evaluation protocols that reveal the principles by which multimodal experiences produce robust, generalizable abstractions and to identify architectural and training interventions that promote such mechanistic learning.
